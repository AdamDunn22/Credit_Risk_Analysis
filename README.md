# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose
Trying to predict someone's credit risk is very difficult to predict so we will be using python and a few machine learning methods to build a few models that we will analyze to help us predict someone's credit risk.

## Results 
### Naive Random Oversampling
* Balanced Accuracy Test 65%
* Percision for High_Risk 1%
* Recall 72%
